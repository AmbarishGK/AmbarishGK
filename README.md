### Hi there, if you are here means that I have made an impression on you either via my profile, LinkedIn page or even face to face, so thank you for looking up my profle :) 

I am a software engineer who likes to spend my time solving problems or (positive spin) finding solutions. I have worked in multiple early stage startups where I learnt how to manage time and work towards deadline, that Business solution is more important, Managing teammates and clients, adapting to situation and juggling tasks etc. Also have 3 developers who I had to oversee as a product owners. I like to work as a team (pair programming/brainstorming etc) but sometimes do it alone if I am too focused.

Little about me in points (0-0):
- I play basketball
- Like cycling
- Would join trekking
- Ready to long drive
- Enjoy Dungeons and Dragons
